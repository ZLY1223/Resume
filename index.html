            <p>Hi there! üëã I‚Äôm a researcher passionate about the intersection of <strong>health informatics, data mining, and NLP</strong>. 
            My background is in <strong>integrating data fusion and topic modeling</strong> to identify diruptive technologies. Currently, I am working in Professor Lauren Gardner‚Äôs lab on an <strong>LLM-based vaccine hesitancy prediction</strong> project, where we use few-shot and chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to enhance the model‚Äôs reasoning process, allowing it to better simulate human vaccine hesitancy responses. A key focus is assessing whether AI can complement or substitute human respondents in public health surveys and identifying biases in LLM-generated predictions.</p>
            
            <p>I'm preparing for a Ph.D. journey and actively seeking <strong>RA opportunities</strong> in <strong>health informatics, NLP, and applied machine learning</strong>. 
            My interests lie in <strong>developing AI models for healthcare applications</strong>, <strong>intergrating Agentic AI approaches, particularly ReAct (Reason + Act) and Digital Reinforcement Learning (DigiRL), to enhance large language models' ability to dynamically retrieve information, optimize decision-making,</strong>. 
            If you're working on something exciting in these areas‚Äîlet‚Äôs connect! üöÄ</p>

                <h3>LLM-based Simulation of Covid-19 Vaccine Attitudes</h3>
                <p>Built comprehensive datasets integrating vaccine attitudes, demographics, and prior belief factors. Using LLaMA-2-7B and other large language models, I simulate vaccine decision-making behaviors to better understand public health interventions.</p>

                <h3>Multi-Pathogen Hospitalization Forecasting Model</h3>
                <p>Designed a forecasting model for influenza, RSV, and COVID-19 hospitalization rates across state, regional, and national levels. The model integrates time-series epidemiological data and applies machine learning techniques for real-time validation. Manuscript submitted to <em>Epidemics</em> journal.</p>
